Coding Forum is a forum like stackoverflow. Well, a bit like stockoverflow :).

# Description <br>
A user can see queries posted by other users, see answers and comments posted on that query. <br>
Search for a query from the search bar.<br>
If a user wants to post a query, they must log in for doing so. And obviously if they haven't registered for an account, they have to do first.<br><br>
